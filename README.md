## A new way to listen to music
Compact Discs adds new ways to listen to music in your Minecraft world, with new CDs & stereo systems.

## The Compact Disc
The main feature of this mod is the new item, the "Compact Disc." Unlike the vanilla records, these discs can be burned with multiple tracks, and be cleared as well, allowing for full control over your playlists.

## The CD Burner
The CD Burner is the main block for putting tracks on your CD, allowing you to add tracks from other discs onto one. 

## The Stereo
The Stereo is the block used to play CDs, it allows you to play and pause your songs, as well as letting you go to the next, and previous tracks.

## What's the plan
I'm planning on adding a lot more features, like more intricate stereo systems, earbuds, portable CD players, and more!
